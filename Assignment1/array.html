    <p>In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.</p>
    <h3>Declaration of an Array </h3>
    <p style="background-color: yellow;">There are basically two ways to declare an array.
        <br>
         Example: 
         <br>

        var House = [ ]; // method 1 
        <br>
        var House = new Array(); // method 2 
        <br>
         
        
        But generally method 1 is preferred over the method 2. Let us understand the reason for this. </p>

        <p>Arrays are non-primitive data type which is mutable that menas we can modify or change the value of objects or we can reassign to stop these behaviour we have to use object.freeze() </p>
