    <h1>Functions in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produces output. Basically, a function is a set of statements that performs some tasks or does some computation and then return the result to the user.

        The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call that function.
        
        Like other programming languages, JavaScript also supports the use of functions. You must already have seen some commonly used functions in JavaScript like alert(), this is a built-in function in JavaScript. But JavaScript allows us to create user-defined functions also.
        
        We can create functions in JavaScript using the keyword function. The basic syntax to create a function in JavaScript is shown below.
        <br>
        
        Syntax:
        <br>
        function functionName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ..)
        <br>
        {

            // Function body
        }
        <br>
        To create a function in JavaScript, we have to first use the keyword function, separated by name of function and parameters within parenthesis. The part of function inside the curly braces {} is the body of the function.</p>

        <h2>Function has block scope that means when we declare a variable inside function we can not access it outside the function</h2>
        <p>Before, using a user-defined function in JavaScript we have to create one. We can use the above syntax to create a function in JavaScript. A function definition is sometimes also termed as function declaration or function statement.</p>
        <ul>
            Below are the rules for creating a function in JavaScript:
            <li>Every function should begin with the keyword function followed by,</li>
            <li>A user defined function name which should be unique,</li>
            <li>A list of parameters enclosed within parenthesis and separated by commas,</li>
            <li>A list of statement composing the body of the function enclosed within curly braces {}.</li>
            <!-- <li></li> -->
        </ul>
