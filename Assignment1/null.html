    <h1>Null values</h1>
    <p>You can assign null to a variable to denote that currently that variable does not have any value but it will have later on. A null means absence of a value.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Example: null
        <br>
        var myVar = null;
        <br>
        
        alert(myVar); // null </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the above example, null is assigned to a variable myVar. It means we have defined a variable but have not assigned any value yet, so value is absence.If you try to find DOM element using document.getElelementByID for example, and if element is found then it will return null. So it is recommended to check for null before doing something with that element.A null value evaluates to false in conditional expression. So you don't have to use comparison operators like === or !== to check for null values.</p>
