    <h1>Number</h1>
    <p>Number is a primitive wrapper object used to represent and manipulate numbers like 37 or -9.25.The Number constructor contains constants and methods for working with numbers. Values of other types can be converted to numbers using the Number() function.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The JavaScript Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value, like double in Java or C#. This means it can represent fractional values, but there are some limits to what it can store. A Number only keeps about 17 decimal places of precision; arithmetic is subject to rounding. The largest value a Number can hold is about 1.8E308. Values higher than that are replaced with the special Number constant Infinity.</p>
