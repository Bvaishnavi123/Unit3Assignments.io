    <h1>OBJECTS</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.</li>
        <li>An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.</li>
        <li>Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</li>
        <li>An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.</li>
        <li>To understand this rather abstract definition, let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :</li>
        <li>let school = {
            name : "Vivekananda School",
            location : "Delhi",
            established : "1971"
        }</li>
        <!-- <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li> -->
    </ul>
    <p>objets are non-primitive data type which is mutable that menas we can modify or change the value of objects or we can reassign </p>
