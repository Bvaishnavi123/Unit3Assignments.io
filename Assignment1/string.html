    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <p>Initially, JavaScript language was created for the browser only. But now, the language is used in many other environments also. It is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content. It means the webpage can move, refresh, or change on the user’s screen without manually reloading a web page.

        String in Javascript: Strings are texts that help in holding data that can be represented.
        
        A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like “GeeksforGeeks”. A string can be any text inside double or single quotes. For example,
        
         var gfg= "geeksforgeeks";
        .
        
        String indexes start from 0. The first character is in position 0 and the second in 1 and the same follows. We can call any of the pre-defined methods of JavaScript as it automatically converts from string primitive to objects.</p>
