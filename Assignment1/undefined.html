        <li>What does undefined mean in JavaScript?
            <br>
          undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. ... A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.</li>
        <li>Accessing the variable evaluates to undefined . An efficient approach to solve the troubles of uninitialized variables is whenever possible assign an initial value. The less the variable exists in an uninitialized state, the better.</li>
        <li>Is null == undefined?
            null is an assigned value. It means nothing. undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.</li>
        <li>JavaScript assigns 'undefined' to any object that has been declared but not initialized or defined. In other words, in a case where no value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it 'undefined'. ... The return value of functions that have to but don't return a value</li>
